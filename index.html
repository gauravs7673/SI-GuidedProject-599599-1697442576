              <br />
              <p>
                "10 Big Cats of the Wild - Image Classification" is an advanced
                machine learning model designed to accurately identify and
                classify ten majestic big cat species from their
                images.Leveraging cutting-edge deep learning algorithms, the
                system can distinguish between theregal profiles of the iconic
                animals, including the awe-inspiring Bengal tiger, the elusive
                snow leopard, the powerful African lion, the agile cheetah, the
                mysterious clouded leopard,the majestic jaguar, the enigmatic
                cougar, the endangered Amur leopard, the graceful serval, and
                the formidable leopard. By combining image recognition
                techniques with extensive training data, this state-of-the-art
                model provides conservationists, wildlife researchers, and
                enthusiasts with a powerful tool to safeguard and appreciate the
                beauty and diversity of these magnificent creatures,
                contributing to their preservation and understanding in their
                natural habitats. With the advancement of technology, many new
                techniques of Deep learning have contributed towards
                classification of images in a more efficient way such as ResNet,
                VGG16, Inception V3 etc.
